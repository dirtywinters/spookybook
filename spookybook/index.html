                    <h1>“KNOBBY” THE APPALACHIAN BIGFOOT</h1>
                    <p>Near the mountains of North Carolina, locals have reported sightings of a large, shaggy creature, standing about 6 feet high, with dark, dirty hair and a flat, human-like face. These sightings are consistent with encounters of the legendary creature Bigfoot, as reported in other parts of the country.</p>

               <div>
                <p>Of the more whimsical beasts I have found is the story of the Wampus Cat. The story of its origin varies by location, but it is often described as a large cat like a mountain lion with green eyes and human-like features.</p>
                <img src="img/collectmypages2/polaroid2.png">
                <p>One story ascribed to the Cherokee states that the Wampus Cat was created when a jealous woman was punished for spying on her husband. Whether or not this legend does in fact come from the Cherokee or was simply made up as an explanation is up for debate.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In any case, the legend of the Wampus Cat has been popular in the region for decades. </p>

                    <p>It is possible that these people refer to a “catawampus”, which simply refers to any unknown creature that might be causing disturbances in the area. The Wampus Cat has been blamed for everything from chickens disappearing from the yard to curdling sourdough with its cries. </p>

                    <p>On some rare nights, one can observe dancing lights over the peak of Brown Mountain, in the deep Appalachians. These lights appear like bright stars broken free of the heavens to galavant across Brown Mountain’s gentle summit.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The true origin of the lights remains a mystery, and although some have attributed them to train lights or electrical lines, their movement and location above the mountain defies any reasonable explanation. </p>
